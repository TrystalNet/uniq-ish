# uniq-ish
Starting a library for creating unique ids suitable for different applications.

Trystal requires unique ids to identify every line within a trist. Documents can be very large, and guids are inefficient overkill, 
and we found that we were often needing unique ids for one reason or another.

Rather than re-invent the wheel for each project, we decided to create this shared project.

We have plans to add some other types of unique ids as requirements dictate.

This code also functions as an example of how to get Typescript/Webpack/Github/NPM working together for a simple project.
